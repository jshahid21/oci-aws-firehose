# OCI-AWS Firehose Deployment (Deprecated)

This project is deprecated. Use **[oci-rclone-sync](../oci-rclone-sync)** for OCI-to-AWS sync.

The event-driven approach (OCI Functions + Events) has been removed in favor of the rclone-based VM polling approach, which supports cross-tenancy Usage Report buckets.
